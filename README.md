# Lockup Lookup 

What is it? LockupLookup is a cheap, safe, and easy way for users to secure their parked bikes at a bike rack. Users can easily use Lockup Lookup to secure their bike, and remotely check-in to ensure their bike hasn't been moved. Deployers of Lockup Lookup receive the frequency of usage for a specific bike rack, and can track anonymized user data that can map out common routes taken by bikers between bike racks.

# Hardware
Using the Arduino micro controller as a base, we designed a simple switch to be activated when the bike is in place and send that data through a WiFi chip. Providing the WiFi chip with a cellular signal will allow the user to view this info using the app.   

# Software
Used Firebase RT Database and Android App to watch it,  
Adruino mock found [here](https://cruzhacks2018-17b9d.firebaseapp.com/) (created w/ Firebase)
