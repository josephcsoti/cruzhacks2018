Product Description: Lockup Lookup is a cheap, safe, and easy way for users to secure their parked bikes at a bike rack. Users can easily use Lockup Lookup to secure their bike, and remotely check-in to ensure their bike hasn't been moved. Deployers of Lockup Lookup receive the frequency of usage for a specific bike rack, and can track anonymized user data that can map out common routes taken by bikers between bike racks.

Work done: 

  -Hardware- Using the Arduino micro controller as a base, we designed a simple switch to be activated when the bike is in place and send that data through a WiFi chip. Providing the WiFi chip with a cellular signal will allow the user to view this info using the app.   

  -Software-

Materials:
